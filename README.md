7. **Analysis:**
   - Analyze the visuals to extract meaningful insights.
8. **Documentation:**
   - Document the process, findings, and recommendations, and publish on GitHub Pages.

### Data Exploration Notes

During the initial exploration of the dataset, the following observations were made:

- **Missing Values:** Some records in the customer details table have missing income information.
- **Inconsistent Formats:** Date formats are inconsistent across different datasets.
- **Outliers:** There are transaction amounts that are significantly higher than the average, indicating possible outliers or fraudulent activities.
- **Duplicate Entries:** Duplicate records are present in the transaction dataset, which need to be addressed.

These issues will be resolved during the data cleaning phase to ensure data integrity.

### Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves several steps to transform and prepare the data for analysis.

#### What should the clean data look like?

The cleaned data should meet the following criteria:

- **Consistency:** Uniform formats for dates, currencies, and text fields.
- **Completeness:** No missing or null values in critical fields.
- **Accuracy:** Correct and logical values across all datasets.
- **Uniqueness:** No duplicate records in any of the tables.

#### Steps to Clean and Shape the Data

1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Impute missing income values using the average income based on occupation and age group.
2. **Formatting Dates:**
   - Standardize all date fields to the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
3. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - Identify and remove duplicate records in the transaction dataset.
4. **Outlier Detection and Treatment:**
   - Use statistical methods to detect outliers in transaction amounts and decide whether to remove or investigate them further.
5. **Data Type Conversion:**
   - Ensure all fields have appropriate data types (e.g., dates as DATE, amounts as DECIMAL).
6. **Creating Derived Columns:**
   - Generate additional columns such as 'Age Group' and 'Income Group' for better segmentation.

#### Transform the Data

**SQL Query:**

```sql
-- 1. Removing duplicates from transactions
WITH CTE_Transactions AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY transaction_id ORDER BY transaction_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM
        transactions
)
DELETE FROM CTE_Transactions WHERE rn > 1;

-- 2. Updating inconsistent date formats
UPDATE transactions
SET transaction_date = CONVERT(DATE, transaction_date, 103)
WHERE ISDATE(transaction_date) = 0;

-- 3. Imputing missing income values
UPDATE customers
SET income = (
    SELECT AVG(income)
    FROM customers AS c
    WHERE c.occupation = customers.occupation AND c.age BETWEEN customers.age - 5 AND customers.age + 5
)
WHERE income IS NULL;

-- 4. Creating Age Group column
ALTER TABLE customers ADD age_group VARCHAR(10);
UPDATE customers
SET age_group = CASE
    WHEN age BETWEEN 20 AND 30 THEN '20-30'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 40 THEN '31-40'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 41 AND 50 THEN '41-50'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 51 AND 60 THEN '51-60'
    ELSE '60+'
END;

-- 5. Creating Income Group column
ALTER TABLE customers ADD income_group VARCHAR(10);
UPDATE customers
SET income_group = CASE
    WHEN income < 35000 THEN 'Low'
    WHEN income BETWEEN 35000 AND 70000 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'High'
END;
```

#### Create the SQL View

**SQL Query:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW vw_credit_card_data AS
SELECT
    t.transaction_id,
    t.transaction_date,
